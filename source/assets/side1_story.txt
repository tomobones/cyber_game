You have a new job in a cyber 
security agency and can't wait
to log in to the terminal (T) 
in your office the first time.
But it's a pitty: You have no 
access yet! First you need to 
get your login password from  
the safe (S). To open it your 
boss gave you a crypto problem
lying on his desk (D). So get 
the job done! But wait: Be    
aware of your peers! they want
to get to know you and won't  
let you work anymore today.
